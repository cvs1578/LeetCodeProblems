# LeetCodeProblems
This repository will focus on me attempting to solve [LeetCode Problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) and keeping record of all the problems I've completed. Note that even though I might come up with a  solution, it might not be the best. This is to increase my current coding skill and to get me more used with Python since my main college coding experience was with C++. 

How I'm choosing the questions: [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/) OR just choosing whatever. NeetCode is great for giving specific questions which correlate to different topics, however sometimes it's just good to try a random question.
